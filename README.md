# Face-Analysis-Tool
Here’s a professional, clean, and well-structured **README** for your **Face-Analysis-Tool**, written in the same style you wanted (like your chess README)

A Facial Analysis Tool for Image Processing  
📂 Repository: [Face-Analysis-Tool](https://github.com/navin0077/Face-Analysis-Tool)

---

## Description  
**Face Analysis Tool** analyzes facial features from an uploaded image. It uses **OpenCV**, **dlib**, and **scipy** to detect landmarks and calculate attributes like **face shape**, **symmetry score**, **jawline type**, and **skin tone**.

---

## Features  
✅ Detects and analyzes facial landmarks  
✅ Identifies face shape (Oval, Round, Heart, Square)  
✅ Calculates facial symmetry score  
✅ Analyzes jawline sharpness  
✅ Detects skin tone (Fair, Medium, Dark)

## Technologies Used  
- Python 3  
- OpenCV  
- dlib (with pre-trained 68 landmark predictor)  
- numpy  
- scipy

## Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navin0077/Face-Analysis-Tool.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python dlib numpy scipy
   ```
3. Download shape predictor file (automatically handled in code).  
4. Run the analysis script and upload your image.  
   ```python
   python analyze_face.py
   ```

## Example Output  
```
🔍 Face Analysis Result:
Face Shape: Round
Symmetry Score: 438.26
Jawline: Sharp Jawline
Skin Tone: Medium
```
